        Amsterdam, city and port, western Netherlands, located on the IJsselmeer
        and connected to the North Sea. It is the capital and the principal
        commercial and financial centre of the Netherlands.Amsterdam is known
        for its historical attractions, for its collections of great art, and
        for the distinctive colour and flavour of its old sections, which have
        been so well preserved.

        Tourism of all kinds is a major and growing economic activity. Many
        visitors to the city come for business purposes or to attend
        conferences, particularly at the large RAI Exhibition and Congress
        Centre. Because it is possible to see many of the sites on foot in a
        single day, day trips to Amsterdam are also extremely popular.However,
        visitors to the city also see a crowded metropolis beset by
        environmental pollution, traffic congestion, and housing shortages. It
        is easy to describe Amsterdam, which is more than 700 years old, as a
        living museum of a bygone age and to praise the eternal beauty of the
        centuries-old canals, the ancient patrician houses, and the atmosphere
        of freedom and tolerance, but the modern city is still working out
        solutions to the pressing urban problems that confront it.

        Amsterdam commands excellent transport connections via rail, water,
        road, and air. Schiphol Airport is among the busiest in Europe and
        indisputably one of the world's major hub airports. Amsterdam's seaport
        also ranks among the most important in Europe, but, overshadowed by the
        huge Rotterdam-Europoort nearby, the Amsterdam docks underwent a gradual
        decline in traffic during the late 20th century. An extensive network of
        superhighways connects Amsterdam with all parts of the Netherlands and
        with Germany and Belgium. Within the city, since the 1960s, planners
        have favoured public transportation to reduce automobile use. A
        high-speed metro line opened in 1976, and a new fast rail link to
        Schiphol entered service in 1988, but trams remain the principal means
        of transportation in inner Amsterdam, while buses are important in outer
        districts.

        Amsterdam is a very popular location for international business, mainly
        because of its combination of accessibility, cultural richness,
        cosmopolitan character, and a human scale that results from the absence
        of high-rise buildings and multilane highways. The Netherlands has
        attracted no less than one-fifth of all U.S. and Japanese investment in
        Europe, and much of this is focused on Amsterdam. The city also is a
        major financial centre, though a less important one than London or
        Frankfurt. All major Dutch banks have their headquarters in the city, as
        do the European Options Exchange and the Dutch branch of the Euronext
        Securities Exchange, and some 60 foreign banks have offices there. The
        city's busy port and excellent land and air transportation links have
        allowed it to maintain its importance as a centre for regional and
        international trade.
