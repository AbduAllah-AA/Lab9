    <h1>The Capital city of China: Beijing</h1>

        Beijing, city, province-level shi (municipality), and capital of the
        People's Republic of China. Few cities in the world have served for so
        long as the political headquarters and cultural centre of an area as
        immense as China. The city has been an integral part of China's history
        over the past eight centuries, and nearly every major building of any
        age in Beijing has at least some national historical significance. The
        importance of Beijing thus makes it impossible to understand China
        without a knowledge of this city.

        The service sector, comprising both private companies and government
        agencies, has expanded significantly as the city's and region's industry
        and population have grown. China has a nationwide and centralized system
        of banking, in which the state-owned People's Bank of China plays a key
        role. This institution, with its head office in the inner city,
        functions as the agent of the national treasury. All funds of
        state-owned industrial enterprises, as well as of national, provincial,
        and local governments, the People's Liberation Army, and the network of
        cooperatives, are deposited with the People's Bank. The bank uses the
        working capital at its disposal for the operations of the economy and
        the government and thus acts as cashier of the national budget and of a
        large part of the country's financial operations. Through its branch
        offices and savings account centres, the bank also serves the daily
        financial needs of people in the city and in the suburbs. Working in
        cooperation with the People's Bank and under its supervision are four
        other banking institutions: the People's Construction Bank, which
        finances and supervises all basic construction projects, such as new
        railways; the Agricultural Bank of China, which specializes in
        agricultural investment; the Bank of Commerce and Industry, which
        provides loans to industry; and the Bank of China, which handles most
        international trade and foreign exchange. In addition, several
        foreign-owned banks have representative offices in the city to assist
        foreign nationals doing business in China.

        During the period when Beijing was the dynastic capital (mid-13th to the
        early 20th century), the city's population slowly fluctuated between
        700,000 and 1,200,000. However, from the fall of the Qing in 1912 to the
        establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, the population rose
        sharply, from about 725,000 to more than 2,000,000. At least three
        factors contributed to this growth: the rural disorder on the North
        China Plain during that period, when much of China was ruled by
        warlords, caused large numbers of migrants to seek the relative safety
        of Beijing; the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931 made Beijing a
        shelter for thousands of refugees from the northeastern provinces; and
        the civil war between the communists and Nationalists brought still more
        refugees to the city.

        Tourism has become increasingly important to the Beijing economy.
        Visitors are drawn not only to the historical and cultural attractions
        of the central city but also to many sites in the rural areas of the
        municipality. Probably the best-known outlying attraction is the Great
        Wall, which can be viewed from designated places northwest and northeast
        of Beijing. Other popular locales include the tombs of the Ming emperors
        to the north of the city and the archaeological site at Zhoukoudian to
        the southwest, where prehistoric hominin fossils have been found. The
        tourist services provided in Beijing have improved steadily, especially
        since the 1980s. Many hotels and hostels have been built, and old ones
        have been renovated and enlarged to meet the growing demand. A major
        construction campaign was undertaken after the city was awarded the 2008
        Summer Olympics. In addition to building facilities needed for the
        Games, the program has enhanced the city's infrastructure, notably
        public transportation.
