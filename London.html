        London, the city, is the capital of the United Kingdom. It is among the
        oldest of the world’s great cities—its history spanning nearly two
        millennia—and one of the most cosmopolitan. By far Britain’s largest
        metropolis, it is also the country’s economic, transportation, and
        cultural center. London is situated in southeastern England, lying
        astride the River Thames some 50 miles (80 km) upstream from its estuary
        on the North Sea.

        As every city has some history, so does London, It possesses a history
        of more than 2000 years but even then it is totally modern. Romans laid
        its foundation, and they called it with the name Londinium. In 2011, its
        population was 7,375. In 1889, the city was given the name of London.
        Since that time, it has also recognized as the Country of London and now
        Greater London. It is a modern city as well. It possesses the elegant
        and stylish features in Mayfair, Hampstead, Knightsbridge, and Chelsea.
        It also provides distinct features in Shoreditch, Camden, and Dalston.
        Moreover, its vast business and the educational center provides
        professionals and artists with too many opportunities

        London is based on many cultures. It is stated as the multi-cultural
        city, and that’s the main reason for me for liking this city. Anyone can
        learn different cultures from here. Anyone can make friendships and
        relationships here. Also, another feature which makes the city most
        favorite for anyone is the behavior of its inhabitants. British people
        are very loving, well- mannered, and considerate
      </p>

        The city is well known for its museums which make it the finest city in
        the world. Most of the museums are free there. The British museums are
        big, and few of them allows free entry. It’s too big that you cannot
        look all the things by visiting only once. Other art museums include
        Victoria, Tate galleries, and Albert Museum. London provides the
        outstanding exhibitions at the Science Museum, Museum of London, London
        Transport Museum, Design Museum, and Natural History Museum
