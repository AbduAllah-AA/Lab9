        Officially the Tokyo Metropolis is the capital of Japan and the most
        populous city in the world with a population of over 14 million
        residents as of 2023.[8] The Tokyo metropolitan area, which includes
        Tokyo and nearby prefectures, is the world's most-populous metropolitan
        area with 40.8 million residents as of 2023. located at the head of
        Tokyo Bay, Tokyo is part of the Kantō region on the central coast of
        Honshu, Japan's largest island. Tokyo serves as Japan's economic center
        and the seat of both the Japanese government and the Emperor of Japan.
        Prior to the 17th century, Tokyo was predominantly a fishing village and
        was named Edo. In 1603, however, the city ascended to political
        prominence after being named the seat of the Tokugawa shogunate. By the
        mid-18th century, Edo emerged as one of the world's most-populous cities
        with a population of over one million people. Following the Meiji
        Restoration in 1868, the imperial capital in Kyoto was moved to Edo, and
        the city was renamed Tokyo

        Tokyo has the largest metropolitan economy in the world. According to a
        study conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Greater Tokyo Area
        (Tokyo–Yokohama, TYO) of 38 million people had a total GDP of $2
        trillion in 2012 (at purchasing power parity), which topped that list.
        Tokyo is a major international finance center it houses the headquarters
        of several of the world's largest investment banks and insurance
        companies, and serves as a hub for Japan's transportation, publishing,
        electronics and broadcasting industries. During the centralized growth
        of Japan's economy following World War II, many large firms moved their
        headquarters from cities such as Osaka (the historical commercial
        capital) to Tokyo, in an attempt to take advantage of better access to
        the government. This trend has begun to slow due to ongoing population
        growth in Tokyo and the high cost of living there.

        As the largest population center in Japan and the site of the country's
        largest broadcasters and studios, Tokyo is frequently the setting for
        many Japanese movies, television shows, animated series' (anime), web
        comics, light novels, video games, and comic books (manga). In the kaiju
        (monster movie) genre, landmarks of Tokyo are usually destroyed by giant
        monsters such as Godzilla and Gamera.
